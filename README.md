# Password manager 

## Introduction
This project aims to create a password management software that allows the user to record essential information such as **password**, **username** 
and the **website** for which these credentials allow access to. The software should be friendly enough for any person to make use of it.
Managing passwords is a tedious task, specially nowadays since websites ask for many specifications for a password to be valid, making them
harder to remember.

The software is pretty simple. A user can create "Collections" that may hold an unlimited number of "Users". 
For example, a user may want to create a Collection named "Entertainment" that stores "Users" with the information necessary to access
entertainment services such as Netflix or Facebook.
