# Password manager 

## Introduction
This project aims to create a password management software that allows the user to record essential information such as **password**, **username** 
and the **website** for which these credentials allow access to. The software should be friendly enough for any person to make use of it.
Managing passwords is a tedious task, specially nowadays since websites ask for many specifications for a password to be valid, making them
harder to remember.

The software is pretty simple. A user can create "Collections" that may hold an unlimited number of "Users". 
For example, a user may want to create a Collection named "Entertainment" that stores "Users" with the information necessary to access
entertainment services such as Netflix or Facebook.


## Current User stories:
P1:
- As a user, I want to be able to create a Collection
- As a user, I want to be able to add a User to a Collection
- As a user, I want to be able to create a User with a name, password and website.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the username, password and website of all Users in all Collections
- As a user, I want to be able to search for all the Users that have a specific username

P2:
- As a user, I want to be able to save my Collections to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my Collections from file

P3:
- Implemented a graphic user interface for all user stories
