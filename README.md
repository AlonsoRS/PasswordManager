# My Personal Project

## A subtitle
This project aims to create a password management software that allows the user to record essential information such as **password**, **username** 
and the **website** for which these credentials allow access to. The software should be friendly enough for any person to make use of it.
Managing passwords is a tedious task, specially nowadays since websites ask for a large amount of specifications for a password to be valid.


Features include:
- Random password generator of user specified length
- Easy copy to clipboard
- User friendly interface
- Save unlimited amount of credentials
